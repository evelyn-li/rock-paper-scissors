# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A project in which I made a simple, web-based implementation of the classic "rock paper scissors" game.

From The Odin Project curriculum: [Part 1](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) and [Part 2](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/dom-manipulation#practice)

## How to Play
Select a move by clicking one of the buttons. This will play one round. Meanwhile the AI opponent will randomly generate a move. Whoever wins the round gets a point, and the first to five points wins the game.

## Development Process
1. I started out by making the easy version of the game that is played from the browser console. This only involves coding the basic game logic.
2. After I got the game to work, I designed a user interface and sketched the layout on paper, including buttons, displays, colors, and other elements.
3. Then I built the UI based off of my design and added DOM methods for showing content on the page. Along the way, I had to refactor the existing logic to work with the DOM instead of the console. 

## Skills Learned
- Using the DOM to manipulate elements and styles
- Listening for and responding to user actions with DOM events
- Applying knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals to code a working game
- Reworking code and breaking down large chunks of logic into smaller functions

## Languages / Technologies
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- VS Code
- Linux terminal
- Git and Github
- Chrome developer tools
